## The Project
    This is my first project I build as a programmer, 
    I made project before that; but they were only HTML & CSS
    there was no programming involved in them, so after I 
    finished the DOM manipulation course I thought
    I had enough confident to make a simple project in JavaScript.

## What the project about
    It's just a simple quote Generator that uses
    the type.fit api to fetch qoutes and then display them on the page


## Tools & Websites I used

        1- Lobster Two 
        2- Alkatra
